subtitle: An anesthesiologist and neuroscientist, doing research about anesthesia, pain and opioids
---

My name is Chong Chen. I was born and grow up in China. I got my MD degree in China, Shanghai Jiaotong University and worked in a hospital as an anesthesiologist for about three years.

After that, I went to Vienna Austria to pursuit my Ph.D. with Prof. Peter Jonas at IST Austria. For my Ph.D, I investigated how a synaptic protein family, called synaptotagmin, contributes to the fast-signalling property of the PV-positive interneurons. I have two publications during the 3.5 years.

After graduating from IST Austria, I moved to Stanford University (then moved to UNC-chapel Hill with the lab) working on pain and opioids.

As an anesthesiologist, I dedicated to conduct research about anesthesiology (including general anesthesia, pain and opioids) in the future. I am currently searching a faculty position mainly in the Department of Anesthesiology.

Besides that, I am a father of two kids. I spend most of my leisure time with them. My hobbies including biking and fishing.
